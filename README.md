## Inspiration
We were inspired by our love of sharing our everyday meals with friends and family. Having a record also encourages healthy eating habits and reflection.

## What it does
Our app allows users to take a photo of what they are eating and view it later through a calendar. This allows users to look back and reflect on what food they've eaten, much like a food diary! There is also a social aspect where users can see what others are eating as well, and react to them. Not only does this keep users accountable for eating meals on time, but also creates a creative space for people to share their unique meals with one another.

## How we built it
We used React-Native Expo and Typescript.

## Challenges we ran into
It was difficult to implement taking photos through the app, as well as include all the features we intended due to the time constraint and lack of experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we have a functional product that can complete the core goal of the app. Despite our limited expertise in React Native/Expo as well as programming in general, we're extremely proud of what we were able to learn and gain from this experience!

## What we learned
We learned how to program more efficiently and in a more organized way.

## What's next for TasteBuds
More features and functionality, such as implementing challenges among users to encourage more creativity and fun in eating, and a more detailed user flow to enhance the user experience!
